# ViaBackwards NBT Mappings

# I DID THESE MAPPINGS MYSELF
I spent around 7+ hours doing these, but unfortunately, I heard rumors about tuffnet client selling out to another client, I'm making these public because it's my work and I'm not involved with tuffnet client anymore.

# How to use?
Scan item nbt and match the protcol number things and then give item texture or something like that
